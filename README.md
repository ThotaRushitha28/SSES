This project focuses on extracting text from images using EasyOCR, a powerful optical character recognition library. It employs several key libraries: **cv2** for image processing, **matplotlib.pyplot** for visualization, **glob** for file handling, and **easyocr** for text extraction. The workflow initiates with loading and converting images from BGR to RGB format. An EasyOCR reader is then set up to recognize English text. The text extraction process yields bounding box coordinates, recognized text, and confidence scores, which can be printed or visualized with bounding boxes overlaid on the original image. Additionally, the project includes optional steps for enhancing text recognition, such as converting images to grayscale, applying thresholding for binary images, and cropping for focused analysis. By utilizing these techniques, the project offers a comprehensive framework for efficient text recognition in various images, adaptable to specific user requirements.
