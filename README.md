1. Import necessary libraries:
●	cv2: This library is used for image processing tasks such as loading, converting, and displaying images.
●	matplotlib.pyplot: This library is used for visualizing images and plotting graphs.
●	glob: This library is used to find files that match a specified pattern, in this case, image files.
●	easyocr: This library provides functions for text recognition, including extracting text from images and determining the bounding boxes of recognized text regions.
2. Load and convert the image:
●	The cv2.imread() function loads the image from the specified path.
●	The cv2.cvtColor() function converts the image from BGR (Blue, Green, Red) color format to RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color format. This is often necessary for image processing tasks and display purposes.
3. Create an EasyOCR reader instance:
●	The eas.Reader() function creates an instance of the EasyOCR reader. The ['en'] argument specifies that the reader should recognize English text. The gpu=False argument indicates that GPU acceleration is not used, which might be suitable for environments without a compatible GPU.
4. Extract text from the image:
●	The reader.readtext() function extracts text from the image. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the following information:
○	Bounding box coordinates: A list of four coordinate pairs defining the bounding box of the recognized text region.
○	Recognized text: The text extracted from the region.
○	Confidence score: A numerical value indicating the confidence of the text recognition.
5. Print or display the extracted text:
●	The extracted text can be printed directly using print(data). This will output the recognized text and its corresponding confidence scores.
●	Alternatively, the code provides an optional section to display the image with bounding boxes around detected text regions and their corresponding confidence scores. This involves iterating through the extracted text data, drawing bounding boxes using cv2.rectangle(), and displaying the image with text and confidence using plt.imshow() and plt.text().
Image processing and manipulation:
The provided code also includes additional image processing and manipulation steps, which are optional:
●	Converting to grayscale:
○	The cv2.cvtColor() function converts the image to grayscale, which can be useful for certain text recognition tasks.
●	Creating a threshold:
○	The cv2.threshold() function applies thresholding to the grayscale image to create a binary image. This can help to isolate the text regions from the background.
●	Displaying images:
○	The plt.imshow() function displays the original image, grayscale image, and thresholded image. This can be helpful for visualizing the different stages of the image processing pipeline.
●	Cropping the image:
○	The image[x, y] syntax is used to crop a specific region of the image. This can be useful if you want to focus on a particular area of the image for text extraction.
●	Applying threshold to the cropped image:
○	The cv2.threshold() function applies thresholding to the cropped grayscale image to create a binary image.
●	Loading annotation data:
○	The pd.read_parquet() function loads annotation data from parquet files. This can be used for evaluation or comparison purposes.
●	Loading glob images:
○	The glob.glob() function finds image files matching a specified pattern. This can be used to process multiple images in a directory.
●	Displaying glob image:
○	The plt.imshow() function displays an image from the glob list.
These additional steps demonstrate how to perform various image processing tasks and visualize the results. You can customize these steps based on your specific requirements and the nature of your images.
